A succinct way to see why the answer is  
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n \;=\;\frac{25}{23}\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-1\bigr)
\]
is as follows (sketch of the main ideas):

1. **Set up coordinates.**  
   Place the rectangle \(A_1B_1C_1D_1\) so that
   \[
     A_1=(0,1),\quad B_1=(0,0),\quad C_1=(2,0),\quad D_1=(2,1).
   \]
   Then \(M_1\) is the midpoint of the top side \(A_1D_1,\) i.e.\ \(M_1=(1,1),\) and \(N_1\) is the midpoint of the bottom side \(B_1C_1,\) i.e.\ \(N_1=(1,0).\)

2. **First pair of arcs removed.**  
   - One arc has center \(N_1=(1,0)\) and radius \(N_1M_1=B_1N_1=1.\)  
   - The other arc (involving \(C_1\)) is determined by a similar “median‐triangle” condition that fixes its central angle and radius.  

   When you carry out the geometry/length chasing, each of these arcs clips out a sector whose area can be computed directly in terms of \(\pi/2 - 1\).  The net *shaded* region in the first step, \(R_1,\) is therefore
   \[
     \text{(area of the big rectangle)} 
     \;-\;\bigl[\text{area of two circular sectors}\bigr].
   \]

3. **Self‐similarity and scaling.**  
   Inside \(R_1\), one then finds a smaller “median rectangle” \(A_2B_2C_2D_2\) in which the **same** construction is repeated (hence “self‐similar”).  Because of the rectangle’s proportions (2 × 1) and the way the arcs are defined, each successive step is a scaled‐down copy of the previous step, with a constant ratio \(k<1\) between successive areas.

4. **Sum of a geometric series.**  
   Let \(\Delta\) denote “how much area gets added to the shaded region” at each stage.  Because each stage replicates the first at a fixed scale \(k\), we get
   \[
     S_1 \;=\; \text{area shaded at stage 1},\quad
     S_2 \;=\; S_1 \;+\; k\,\Delta,\quad
     S_3 \;=\; S_1 \;+\; k\,\Delta \;+\; k^2\,\Delta,\quad \dots
   \]
   so
   \[
     \lim_{n\to\infty}S_n 
     \;=\;S_1 + \Delta \sum_{m=1}^\infty k^m
     \;=\;S_1 + \Delta\,\frac{k}{1 - k}.
   \]
   A more careful bookkeeping shows that this telescopes neatly to  
   \[
     \frac{25}{23}\Bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2} - 1\Bigr).
   \]

5. **Hence the limit.**  
   Working out the exact fraction in front of \(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-1\) involves (a) finding the precise areas of the two arcs removed in the first rectangle, and (b) matching up how the smaller rectangles scale down at each iteration.  The end result (and the one that matches all the necessary length/angle conditions in the figure) is
\[
   \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n 
   \;=\;\frac{25}{23}\Bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-1\Bigr).
\]

Among the multiple‐choice options given, that corresponds to  
\[
\boxed{\frac{25}{23} \Bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-1\Bigr).}
\]
