**Solution Outline**

The key to this problem is correctly interpreting the given relationship

\[
\frac{v_c}{v} \;=\; 1 \;-\; k \,\log\!\bigl(\tfrac{x}{R}\bigr),
\]

together with the information about where the velocity is half ( \(v=\tfrac12\,v_c\) ) and one‐third ( \(v=\tfrac13\,v_c\) ) of the center velocity.

## 1.  Interpreting the “point \(\tfrac{R^{27}}{23}\) away from the center”

A common source of confusion is the notation 
\[
\tfrac{R^{27}}{23}.
\]
In many exam or textbook problems (especially where the answer choices are fractions like \( \frac{31}{23}, \frac{33}{23}, \dots\)),  
this often actually means
\[
x \;=\; R^{\tfrac{27}{23}}
\quad\text{rather than}\quad
x \;=\; \frac{R^{27}}{23}.
\]
Indeed, if one literally took \(\frac{R^{27}}{23}\) with \(R<1\) in meters, one would run into dimensional inconsistencies (and it also becomes very hard to match the nice fractional answers given).  

By contrast, writing
\[
x \;=\; R^{\frac{27}{23}}
\]
makes \(x\) a pure power of \(R\);  and then it is perfectly consistent to look for another point of the form \(x = R^a\) (where \(a\) is also some rational number).  

Hence, the usual interpretation is:

> **“When the water’s velocity is half the center velocity at the point \(x=R^{27/23}\), find \(a\) so that at \(x = R^a\) the velocity is one‐third the center velocity.”**

This interpretation fits neatly with the multiple‐choice answers (which are all of the form \(\tfrac{\text{odd integer}}{23}\)) and leads to a clean solution.

## 2.  Setting up the two conditions

### 2a)  Velocity is half of \(v_c\) at \(x = R^{27/23}\)

Being “half” means
\[
\frac{v}{v_c} \;=\; \tfrac12
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\frac{v_c}{v} \;=\; 2.
\]
Plug \(x=R^{27/23}\) into the given formula:
\[
\frac{v_c}{v}
\;=\;
1 \;-\; k \,\log\!\Bigl(\tfrac{x}{R}\Bigr)
\;=\;
2.
\]
Hence
\[
2 
\;=\; 
1 \;-\; k \,\log\!\Bigl(\tfrac{R^{27/23}}{R}\Bigr)
\;=\;
1 
\;-\; 
k\,\log\!\bigl(R^{\tfrac{27}{23}-1}\bigr).
\]
Observe that 
\(\tfrac{27}{23}-1 \;=\;\tfrac{4}{23}\), so
\[
\log\!\bigl(R^{\tfrac{4}{23}}\bigr)
\;=\;
\tfrac{4}{23}\,\log(R).
\]
Thus
\[
2 
\;=\;
1 \;-\; k \,\Bigl(\tfrac{4}{23}\,\log R\Bigr)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
1 
\;=\;
-\,k\,\bigl(\tfrac{4}{23}\bigr)\,\log R.
\]
Solving for \(k\) gives
\[
k 
\;=\;
-\,\frac{23}{4\,\log R}.
\]
*(We do not need to solve numerically for \(\log R\); just keep \(k\) in this form.)*

---

### 2b)  Velocity is one‐third of \(v_c\) at \(x = R^a\)

Being “one‐third” means
\[
\frac{v}{v_c} 
\;=\;
\tfrac13
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\frac{v_c}{v} 
\;=\;
3.
\]
Now plug \(x=R^a\) into the same velocity‐ratio formula:
\[
3
\;=\;
1 
\;-\; 
k\,\log\!\Bigl(\tfrac{R^a}{R}\Bigr)
\;=\;
1 
\;-\; 
k\,\log\!\bigl(R^{\,a-1}\bigr)
\;=\;
1 
\;-\; 
k\,(a-1)\,\log R.
\]
Hence
\[
3 - 1 
\;=\;
2
\;=\;
-\,k\,(a-1)\,\log R
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
k\,(a-1)\,\log R 
\;=\;
-2.
\]

---

## 3.  Eliminating \(k\) to solve for \(a\)

From above we have

1.  
\(\displaystyle
k \;=\; -\,\frac{23}{4\,\log R}
\)

2.  
\(\displaystyle
k\,(a-1)\,\log R \;=\; -\,2.
\)

Substitute the expression for \(k\) into the second equation:

\[
\bigl(-\tfrac{23}{4\,\log R}\bigr)\,\bigl(a-1\bigr)\,\log R
\;=\;
-2.
\]
Inside the left‐hand side, \(\log R\) cancels:

\[
-\,\frac{23}{4}\,(a-1)
\;=\;
-2
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\frac{23}{4}\,(a-1)
\;=\;
2
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
a-1
\;=\;
\frac{2\,\cdot 4}{23}
\;=\;
\frac{8}{23}.
\]
Hence
\[
a 
\;=\;
1 \;+\; \frac{8}{23}
\;=\;
\frac{31}{23}.
\]

That matches **option (5)** in the problem’s multiple‐choice list.

## 4.  Final Answer

\[
\boxed{\; \frac{31}{23} \;}
\]

Therefore,  
when the water’s velocity is one‐third of the center velocity, the distance from the center is \(R^{\frac{31}{23}}\). 

(The key step was realizing that the notation \(\tfrac{R^{27}}{23}\) was very likely shorthand for \(R^{27/23}\), which is a common convention in problems that yield nice rational exponents for the answer.)
