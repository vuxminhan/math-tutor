This typically involves solving the equation $5x + k = f(x)$ and ensuring it has two distinct solutions.\"},{\"output\":\"Assuming $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, say $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the intersection points are found by solving $5x + k = ax^2 + bx + c$.\",\"explanation\":\"For a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the line $y = 5x + k$ intersects it at points where $5x + k = ax^2 + bx + c$.
