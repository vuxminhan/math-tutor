If the result is 5 or 6, 2 white balls are added to the pocket. If the result is 1, 2, 3, or 4, 1 black ball is added to the pocket.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Calculating probabilities]:\",\"explanation\":\"The probability of rolling a 5 or 6 is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\), and the probability of rolling 1, 2, 3, or 4 is \\\\(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Possible outcomes after 5 trials]:\",\"explanation\":\"We need to find the combinations of white and black balls such that the total is at least 7. Let \\\\(x\\\\) be the number of times 5 or 6 is rolled (adding 2 white balls each time), and \\\\(y\\\\) be the number of times 1, 2, 3, or 4 is rolled (adding 1 black ball each time).
