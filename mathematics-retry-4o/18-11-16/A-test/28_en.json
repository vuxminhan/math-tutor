The total number of ways to arrange these 7 balls is given by the permutation formula for arranging items with repetitions:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{7!}{4!3!} = \\\\frac{5040}{24 \\\\times 6} = 35.\\n\\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Calculate favorable arrangements]:\",\"explanation\":\"We need to arrange the balls such that no two balls with the same number are adjacent. We will consider the arrangements for each number separately.\\n\\n- **Number 4:** There are two balls with the number 4 (one white and one black). To ensure they are not adjacent, we can place them in different positions among the 7 slots. There are 6 gaps between the 7 positions (before the first ball, between balls, and after the last ball). We choose 2 of these gaps to place the number 4 balls, which can be done in \\\\(\\\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\\\) ways.\\n\\n- **Number 5 and 6:** Each has only one ball, so there is no restriction for these numbers.\\n\\nThus, the number of favorable arrangements is 15.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Calculate probability]:\",\"explanation\":\"The probability that no two balls with the same number are adjacent is the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{15}{35} = \\\\frac{3}{7}.\\n\\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 4 [Find coprime numbers and sum]:\",\"explanation\":\"The fraction \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{7}\\\\) is already in its simplest form, where 3 and 7 are coprime numbers.
