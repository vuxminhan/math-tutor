Points P, Q, and R move on sides AB, BC, and CA respectively. We need to find the area of the region represented by point X, which is defined by the given vector equation.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Vector equation interpretation]:\",\"explanation\":\"The vector equation \\\\( \\\\overrightarrow{AX} = \\\\frac{1}{4}(\\\\overrightarrow{AP}+\\\\overrightarrow{AR}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\overrightarrow{AQ} \\\\) suggests that point X is a weighted average of points P, Q, and R. This means X is a point inside the triangle ABC, determined by the positions of P, Q, and R.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Area of triangle with moving points]:\",\"explanation\":\"Since P, Q, and R are on the sides of triangle ABC, the locus of point X will form a smaller triangle inside ABC. The coefficients in the vector equation determine how X is positioned relative to P, Q, and R.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 4 [Calculating the area of the region]:\",\"explanation\":\"The coefficients \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\) in the vector equation suggest that X divides the triangle into smaller regions. The area of the region represented by X is a fraction of the area of triangle ABC. Specifically, the coefficients imply that the area of the region is a fraction of the original area, determined by the weights \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 5 [Determine the fraction of the area]:\",\"explanation\":\"The vector equation can be interpreted as a weighted centroid calculation. The weights \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\) suggest that the area of the region represented by X is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\) of the area of triangle ABC.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 6 [Calculate the area of the region]:\",\"explanation\":\"Since the area of triangle ABC is 9, the area of the region represented by point X is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\times 9 = \\\\frac{9}{8} \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 7 [Simplifying the fraction]:\",\"explanation\":\"The area of the region is \\\\( \\\\frac{9}{8} \\\\), where 9 and 8 are coprime numbers.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 8 [Finding p and q]:\",\"explanation\":\"In the fraction \\\\( \\\\frac{9}{8} \\\\), \\\\( p = 8 \\\\) and \\\\( q = 9 \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( p + q = 8 + 9 = 17 \\\\).\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\boxed{17}\"}",
