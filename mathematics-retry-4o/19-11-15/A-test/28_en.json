The conditions are:\\n- Odd numbers (1, 3, 5) can be used at most once.\\n- Even numbers (2, 4, 6) can be used at most twice.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Counting possibilities for odd numbers]:\",\"explanation\":\"Each odd number (1, 3, 5) can be used 0 or 1 time. Thus, for each odd number, there are 2 choices (either use it once or not at all). Since there are 3 odd numbers, the total number of ways to choose odd numbers is:\\n\\\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Counting possibilities for even numbers]:\",\"explanation\":\"Each even number (2, 4, 6) can be used 0, 1, or 2 times. Thus, for each even number, there are 3 choices (use it 0, 1, or 2 times). Since there are 3 even numbers, the total number of ways to choose even numbers is:\\n\\\\[ 3^3 = 27 \\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 4 [Combining choices]:\",\"explanation\":\"The total number of ways to choose the numbers satisfying both conditions is the product of the choices for odd and even numbers:\\n\\\\[ 2^3 \\\\times 3^3 = 8 \\\\times 27 = 216 \\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 5 [Arranging the numbers]:\",\"explanation\":\"Each selection of numbers can be arranged in 5! ways to form a five-digit number. Therefore, the total number of five-digit numbers is:\\n\\\\[ 216 \\\\times 5! = 216 \\\\times 120 = 25920 \\\\]\"},{\"output\":\"Step 6 [Final calculation]:\",\"explanation\":\"Thus, the total number of five-digit numbers that can be formed under the given conditions is:\\n\\\\[ 25920 \\\\]\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\boxed{25920}\"}",
