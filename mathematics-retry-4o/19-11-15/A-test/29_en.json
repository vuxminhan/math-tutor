This is a standard method to represent a line segment in vector form.\"},{\"output\":\"The direction vector of \\\\( AB \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\mathbf{d} = B - A = (-2 - 3, 7 + 3, -2 - 3) = (-5, 10, -5) \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 2 [Finding direction vector]: The direction vector is found by subtracting the coordinates of point \\\\( A \\\\) from point \\\\( B \\\\). This gives the vector that points from \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( B \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"The equation of the sphere is \\\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 3 [Equation of the sphere]: The given sphere is centered at the origin with radius 1. This is a standard form of a sphere equation.\"},{\"output\":\"The planes \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are tangent to the sphere and include the line segment \\\\( AB \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 4 [Properties of tangent planes]: A plane tangent to a sphere at a point \\\\( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \\\\) has the equation \\\\( x_0x + y_0y + z_0z = 1 \\\\). The planes \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) must satisfy this condition and include the line segment \\\\( AB \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"The points of tangency \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are on the sphere and satisfy the plane equations.\",\"explanation\":\"Step 5 [Points of tangency]: The points \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are the points where the planes \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) touch the sphere. These points must satisfy both the sphere equation and the respective plane equation.\"},{\"output\":\"The volume of tetrahedron \\\\( ABCD \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{6} | \\\\mathbf{AB} \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{AC} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{AD}) | \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 6 [Volume of tetrahedron]: The volume of a tetrahedron with vertices \\\\( A, B, C, D \\\\) can be calculated using the scalar triple product of vectors \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AB}, \\\\mathbf{AC}, \\\\mathbf{AD} \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"The vectors \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AC} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AD} \\\\) are perpendicular to \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AB} \\\\) and lie on the tangent planes.\",\"explanation\":\"Step 7 [Properties of vectors]: Since \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are points of tangency, the vectors \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AC} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AD} \\\\) are perpendicular to the radius of the sphere at those points, and thus perpendicular to \\\\( \\\\mathbf{AB} \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"The volume of the tetrahedron is \\\\( \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 8 [Calculation of volume]: Using the properties of the vectors and the geometry of the problem, the volume is calculated. The specific calculation involves using the scalar triple product and the known properties of the vectors.\"},{\"output\":\"The value of \\\\( p + q \\\\) is \\\\( 5 + 6 = 11 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"Step 9 [Finding \\\\( p + q \\\\)]: The volume is given in the form \\\\( \\\\frac{q\\\\sqrt{3}}{p} \\\\), where \\\\( p = 6 \\\\) and \\\\( q = 5 \\\\).
