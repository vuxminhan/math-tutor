This implies that the numerator \\\\( a_n + 1 \\\\) grows slower than the denominator \\\\( 3^n + 2^{2n-1} \\\\) as \\\\( n \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Analyzing the geometric sequence]:\",\"explanation\":\"In a geometric sequence, \\\\( a_n = a_1 \\\\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\), where \\\\( a_1 \\\\) is the first term and \\\\( r \\\\) is the common ratio. For the limit to be zero, \\\\( a_n = a_1 \\\\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\) must grow slower than \\\\( 3^n + 2^{2n-1} \\\\).

Since the limit condition implies \\\\( |r| < 3 \\\\), we need to find \\\\( a_2 \\\\) such that it matches one of the given choices. Without loss of generality, assume \\\\( a_1 = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( r = 2 \\\\) (since \\\\( |r| < 3 \\\\) allows for \\\\( r = 2 \\\\)). Then, \\\\( a_2 = 1 \\\\cdot 2 = 2 \\\\).
