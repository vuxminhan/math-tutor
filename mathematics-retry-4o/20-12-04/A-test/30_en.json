        "content": "{\"steps\":[{\"output\":\"Let the cubic function be $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Since the highest degree coefficient is 1, the leading term is $x^3$.\",\"explanation\":\"We are given that the cubic function $f(x)$ has the highest degree coefficient of 1, which means the leading term is $x^3$. The general form of a cubic function is $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$.\"},{\"output\":\"The function $g(x) = f(\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x)$ is defined on the set of all real numbers. We need to find the critical points of $g(x)$ in the interval $0 < x < 1$.\",\"explanation\":\"The function $g(x)$ is defined as $f(\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x)$. We need to analyze the behavior of $g(x)$ in the interval $0 < x < 1$ to find the critical points.\"},{\"output\":\"Since $g(x) = f(\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x)$, the critical points occur when $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ is at its extreme values. The extreme values of $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ are 0 and 1.\",\"explanation\":\"The function $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ oscillates between 0 and 1. The critical points of $g(x)$ occur when $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ reaches these extreme values.\"},{\"output\":\"The extreme values of $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ in $0 < x < 1$ are $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x = 0$ at $x = 0, 1$ and $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x = 1$ at $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"The function $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x$ reaches 0 at $x = 0, 1$ and 1 at $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ within the interval $0 < x < 1$.\"},{\"output\":\"Since $g(x)$ has 3 extreme values in $0 < x < 1$ and all these extreme values are the same, $f(0) = f(1) = f(1)$.\",\"explanation\":\"The problem states that $g(x)$ has 3 extreme values in $0 < x < 1$ and they are all the same. This implies $f(0) = f(1) = f(1)$.\"},{\"output\":\"The maximum value of $g(x)$ is $\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and the minimum value is 0. Therefore, $f(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ and $f(0) = 0$.\",\"explanation\":\"The maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$ are given as $\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and 0, respectively. Since $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x = 1$ at $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, $f(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\\\sin^2 \\\\pi x = 0$ at $x = 0, 1$, $f(0) = 0$.\"},{\"output\":\"Since $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $f(0) = c = 0$.\",\"explanation\":\"The function $f(x)$ is given by $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Since $f(0) = 0$, it follows that $c = 0$.\"},{\"output\":\"We also have $f(1) = 1 + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"Substituting $x = 1$ into $f(x)$ gives $f(1) = 1 + a + b$. Since $f(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, we have $1 + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\"},{\"output\":\"Solving $1 + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ gives $a + b = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"Rearranging the equation $1 + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ gives $a + b = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$.\"},{\"output\":\"We need to find $f(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b$.\",\"explanation\":\"Substituting $x = 2$ into $f(x)$ gives $f(2) = 2^3 + 4a + 2b = 8 + 4a + 2b$.\"},{\"output\":\"Since $f(2) = a + b\\\\sqrt{2}$, equate $8 + 4a + 2b = a + b\\\\sqrt{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"The problem states $f(2) = a + b\\\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $8 + 4a + 2b = a + b\\\\sqrt{2}$.\"},{\"output\":\"Equating the rational and irrational parts gives $8 + 4a = a$ and $2b = b\\\\sqrt{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"By comparing the rational and irrational parts of $8 + 4a + 2b = a + b\\\\sqrt{2}$, we get two equations: $8 + 4a = a$ and $2b = b\\\\sqrt{2}$.\"},{\"output\":\"Solving $8 + 4a = a$ gives $a = -\\\\frac{8}{3}$.\",\"explanation\":\"Rearranging $8 + 4a = a$ gives $3a = -8$, so $a = -\\\\frac{8}{3}$.\"},{\"output\":\"Solving $2b = b\\\\sqrt{2}$ gives $b = 0$.\",\"explanation\":\"Rearranging $2b = b\\\\sqrt{2}$ gives $b(2 - \\\\sqrt{2}) = 0$. Since $2 - \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\neq 0$, $b = 0$.\"},{\"output\":\"Thus, $a = -\\\\frac{8}{3}$ and $b = 0$.\",\"explanation\":\"From the previous steps, we found $a = -\\\\frac{8}{3}$ and $b = 0$.\"},{\"output\":\"Calculate $a^2 + b^2 = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\\\frac{64}{9}$.\",\"explanation\":\"Substituting $a = -\\\\frac{8}{3}$ and $b = 0$ into $a^2 + b^2$ gives $\\\\left(-\\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\\\frac{64}{9}$.\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{64}{9}}\"}",
