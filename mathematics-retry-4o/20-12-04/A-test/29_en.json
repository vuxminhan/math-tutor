This leaves us with 2 black hats to distribute among the four students.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Distribute remaining black hats]:\",\"explanation\":\"We have 2 black hats left to distribute among students B, C, and D. We need to ensure that exactly one of these students receives more black hats than white hats. This means one of B, C, or D must receive at least 2 black hats, while the others receive fewer black hats than white hats.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Choose the student to receive more black hats]:\",\"explanation\":\"We choose one student from B, C, or D to receive 2 black hats. There are 3 choices for this student.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 4 [Distribute white hats]:\",\"explanation\":\"After distributing black hats, we have 6 white hats to distribute among the four students. Each student must receive at least one hat, and the student who received 2 black hats must receive fewer white hats than black hats. Therefore, this student receives 0 or 1 white hat.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 5 [Calculate distributions]:\",\"explanation\":\"For the student who received 2 black hats, they can receive 0 white hats (leaving 6 white hats for the other three students) or 1 white hat (leaving 5 white hats for the other three students).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 6 [Distribute remaining white hats]:\",\"explanation\":\"If the student receives 0 white hats, we distribute 6 white hats to the remaining three students, ensuring each receives at least 1 hat. This can be done in \\\\( \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\\\) ways (distributing 3 remaining hats after giving 1 to each). If the student receives 1 white hat, we distribute 5 white hats to the remaining three students, ensuring each receives at least 1 hat. This can be done in \\\\( \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\\\) ways.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 7 [Calculate total ways]:\",\"explanation\":\"For each choice of the student receiving 2 black hats, there are 10 ways if they receive 0 white hats and 6 ways if they receive 1 white hat. Thus, there are \\\\( 3 \\\\times (10 + 6) = 48 \\\\) ways in total.\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\boxed{48}\"}",
