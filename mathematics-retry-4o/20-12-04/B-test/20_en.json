This involves finding the derivative of $g(x)$ and analyzing its roots.\"},{\"output\":\"First, we compute the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$.\",\"explanation\":\"The derivative of a function gives us the critical points, which are potential extreme values. We need to find $g'(x)$.\"},{\"output\":\"The function $g(x)$ is given by:\\n\\\\[\\ng(x) = x^2 \\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt - \\\\int_0^x t^2 f(t) \\\\, dt\\n\\\\]\",\"explanation\":\"This is the expression for $g(x)$ that we need to differentiate.\"},{\"output\":\"Using the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign, we find:\\n\\\\[\\ng'(x) = 2x \\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt + x^2 f(x) - x^2 f(x)\\n\\\\]\",\"explanation\":\"The Leibniz rule helps us differentiate expressions involving integrals with variable limits.\"},{\"output\":\"Simplifying, we have:\\n\\\\[\\ng'(x) = 2x \\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt\\n\\\\]\",\"explanation\":\"The terms $x^2 f(x)$ cancel out, simplifying the expression for $g'(x)$.\"},{\"output\":\"For $g(x)$ to have only one extreme value, $g'(x)$ should have only one root. This means $\\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt$ should have only one root.\",\"explanation\":\"The number of roots of $g'(x)$ determines the number of extreme values of $g(x)$. We need $g'(x)$ to have only one root.\"},{\"output\":\"The function $f(x) = (x+1)(x-1)(x-a)$ is a cubic polynomial. The integral $\\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt$ is a quartic polynomial.\",\"explanation\":\"Integrating a cubic polynomial results in a quartic polynomial.\"},{\"output\":\"A quartic polynomial can have up to 4 roots. For it to have only one root, it must be of the form $(x-r)^4$ or similar, which is unlikely given the structure of $f(x)$.\",\"explanation\":\"The structure of $f(x)$ suggests that the integral will not simplify to a form with only one root unless specific conditions on $a$ are met.\"},{\"output\":\"To ensure $g'(x)$ has only one root, $f(x)$ must be such that $\\\\int_0^x f(t) \\\\, dt$ has a specific form. This occurs when $a$ is chosen such that $f(x)$ has a double root.\",\"explanation\":\"A double root in $f(x)$ can lead to a simpler form for the integral, potentially reducing the number of roots.\"},{\"output\":\"The roots of $f(x)$ are $-1$, $1$, and $a$. For $f(x)$ to have a double root, two of these must coincide. The only possibility is $a = 1$ or $a = -1$, but $a > 1$.\",\"explanation\":\"We need to find a value of $a$ greater than 1 that simplifies the root structure of $f(x)$.\"},{\"output\":\"The maximum value of $a$ that allows $g(x)$ to have only one extreme value is when $a = 2\\\\sqrt{2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"This value of $a$ ensures that $f(x)$ has a double root, simplifying the integral and reducing the number of roots of $g'(x)$.\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\MC: boxed{1}\"}",
