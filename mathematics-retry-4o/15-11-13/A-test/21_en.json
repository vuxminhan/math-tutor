This implies that \\\\(f(x)\\\\) changes sign at \\\\(x = -1\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(f(-1) = 0\\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Understanding the root condition]:\",\"explanation\":\"The function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) has at least one real root in the interval \\\\([3, 5]\\\\). This means \\\\(f(x)\\\\) must be zero for some \\\\(x\\\\) in this interval.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Formulating the cubic function]:\",\"explanation\":\"A general cubic function can be written as \\\\(f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\\\).

We need to maximize and minimize this expression under the given conditions.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 7 [Analyzing the expression]:\",\"explanation\":\"The expression \\\\(\\\\frac{c}{d}\\\\) can be maximized or minimized by choosing appropriate values of \\\\(a, b, c\\\\) such that the constraints are satisfied. Since \\\\(f(-1) = 0\\\\), we have \\\\(d = a - b + c\\\\). The root condition in \\\\([3, 5]\\\\) implies that the cubic function must cross the x-axis in this interval.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 8 [Choosing specific values]:\",\"explanation\":\"Let's choose specific values to satisfy the conditions:\\n- Let \\\\(f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 3)(x - 5)\\\\). This satisfies both conditions: \\\\(f(-1) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(f(x) = 0\\\\) in \\\\([3, 5]\\\\).\\n- Expanding, \\\\(f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 11x + 15\\\\).\\n- Here, \\\\(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 14x + 11\\\\), so \\\\(f'(0) = 11\\\\) and \\\\(f(0) = 15\\\\).\\n- Thus, \\\\(\\\\frac{f'(0)}{f(0)} = \\\\frac{11}{15}\\\\).\"},{\"output\":\"Step 9 [Finding M and m]:\",\"explanation\":\"By symmetry and the nature of cubic polynomials, the maximum and minimum values of \\\\(\\\\frac{f'(0)}{f(0)}\\\\) are achieved when the polynomial is symmetric about its roots.
