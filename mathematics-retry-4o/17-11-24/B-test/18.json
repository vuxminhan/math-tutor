There are 4 boxes, so there are \\\\( \\\\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\\\) ways to choose this box.\",\"explanation\":\"We start by selecting one box that will contain exactly one ball. This is a combinatorial selection problem where we choose 1 box out of 4.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 2 [Distribute remaining balls]:\\n- After placing 1 ball in the chosen box, we have 3 balls left to distribute among the remaining 3 boxes.\\n- The number of ways to distribute 3 balls into 3 boxes such that no box is empty is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, \\\\( S(3, 3) = 1 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"We need to distribute the remaining 3 balls into the 3 remaining boxes. Since each box must contain at least one ball, this is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition 3 items into 3 non-empty subsets.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 3 [Calculate total ways]:\\n- Multiply the number of ways to choose the box with 1 ball by the number of ways to distribute the remaining balls: \\\\( 4 \\\\times 1 = 4 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"We multiply the number of ways to choose the box with exactly 1 ball by the number of ways to distribute the remaining balls among the other boxes.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 4 [Consider other cases]:\\n- We need to consider cases where there are more than one box with exactly 1 ball.\\n- For 2 boxes with 1 ball each: Choose 2 boxes from 4, \\\\( \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\\\), and distribute 2 balls into 2 boxes, \\\\( S(2, 2) = 1 \\\\). Total: \\\\( 6 \\\\times 1 = 6 \\\\).\\n- For 3 boxes with 1 ball each: Choose 3 boxes from 4, \\\\( \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\\\), and distribute 1 ball into 1 box, \\\\( S(1, 1) = 1 \\\\). Total: \\\\( 4 \\\\times 1 = 4 \\\\).\\n- For 4 boxes with 1 ball each: Only 1 way, \\\\( \\\\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"We need to account for all possible distributions where at least one box has exactly 1 ball, including cases where more than one box has exactly 1 ball.\"},{\"output\":\"Step 5 [Sum all cases]:\\n- Total number of ways: \\\\( 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15 \\\\).\",\"explanation\":\"We sum the number of ways for each case to find the total number of distributions where at least one box has exactly 1 ball.\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\MC: boxed{5}\"}",
