This involves using the product rule and chain rule for differentiation.\"},{\"output\":\"The derivative of $2x$ with respect to $x$ is $2$.\",\"explanation\":\"The term $2x$ is a simple linear term, so its derivative is straightforward.\"},{\"output\":\"For $x^2y$, use the product rule: $\\\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2y) = x^2 \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xy$.\",\"explanation\":\"The product rule states that the derivative of a product $uv$ is $u'v + uv'$. Here, $u = x^2$ and $v = y$, so $u' = 2x$ and $v' = \\\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\"},{\"output\":\"For $-y^3$, use the chain rule: $\\\\frac{d}{dx}(-y^3) = -3y^2 \\\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\",\"explanation\":\"The chain rule is used here because $y$ is a function of $x$. The derivative of $y^3$ with respect to $y$ is $3y^2$, and then we multiply by $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\"},{\"output\":\"Combine the derivatives: $2 + x^2 \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xy - 3y^2 \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\",\"explanation\":\"We combine all the differentiated terms to form a single equation.\"},{\"output\":\"Rearrange to solve for $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$: $(x^2 - 3y^2) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2xy - 2$.\",\"explanation\":\"We collect all terms involving $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$ on one side and the remaining terms on the other side.\"},{\"output\":\"Solve for $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$: $\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{-2xy - 2}{x^2 - 3y^2}$.\",\"explanation\":\"We isolate $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$ by dividing both sides by $(x^2 - 3y^2)$.\"},{\"output\":\"Substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ into $\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{-2xy - 2}{x^2 - 3y^2}$ to find the slope at $(1,1)$.\",\"explanation\":\"We need to evaluate the derivative at the given point to find the slope of the tangent line.\"},{\"output\":\"Substitute: $\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{-2(1)(1) - 2}{1^2 - 3(1)^2} = \\\\frac{-2 - 2}{1 - 3} = \\\\frac{-4}{-2} = 2$.\",\"explanation\":\"We substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ into the expression for $\\\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and simplify to find the slope.\"}],\"final_answer\":\"\\\\boxed{2}\"}",
